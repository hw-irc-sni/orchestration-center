# Orchestration Center - Google Cloud Platform Containerized Deployment Guide

This guide helps you deploy the Orchestration Center to Google Cloud Platform **step by step**, no technical background required.

---

## Prerequisites

You need a **Google Cloud account** (sign up with Gmail), and a **GCP project** with billing enabled.

> New users get $300 free credit. Orchestration Center requires one Cloud SQL instance (~$0.015/hour); if deployed alongside Registry Center in the same project, two Cloud SQL instances total ~$0.03/hour.

### How to create a GCP project (if you don't have one)

1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com in your browser
2. Log in with your Gmail account
3. Click **"Select project"** → **"New project"** at the top
4. Pick any project name (e.g. `openan-proj`), click **"Create"**
5. After creation, go to **"Billing"** in the left menu → link a billing account (credit card or PayPal)
6. **Note your project ID** (GCP auto-appends digits, format like `openan-proj-123456`)

---

## Deployment steps (just 3 steps)

### Step 1: Install gcloud CLI

Open PowerShell (right-click Start menu → "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"), copy and run:

```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:TEMP\gcloud-installer.exe"); Start-Process "$env:TEMP\gcloud-installer.exe" -Wait
```

During installation:
- Accept all defaults, click **Next**
- **Check** "Run gcloud init" or "Start shell after installation"
- If a command-line window asks you to log in, use your Gmail account and select the project you just created

> After installation, **close PowerShell and open a new one**.

---

### Step 2: Check login status

In the new PowerShell window, run:

```powershell
gcloud auth list
```

If you see your Gmail account listed, you're logged in.

If not, run `gcloud auth login` — it will open a browser for you to log in.

---

### Step 3: Deploy Registry Center first, then Orchestration Center

Orchestration Center depends on Registry Center for Agent information, so **deploy Registry Center first**.

#### Same project (recommended)

Both services in one GCP project:

```powershell
# Deploy Registry Center first
cd PATH_TO_REGISTRY_CENTER
.\deploy-all.ps1

# Then deploy Orchestration Center
cd PATH_TO_ORCHESTRATION_CENTER
.\deploy-all.ps1
```

> Replace `PATH_TO_...` with actual paths. For example:
> ```powershell
> cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\registry-center
> cd C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\orchestration-center
> ```

When running the Orchestration Center deploy script, it will prompt for:
1. **GCP Project ID** — the one you noted earlier (use the same one as Registry Center)
2. **Registry Center** — the script auto-detects the Registry Center in the same project and prompts "Link to this Registry Center? Y/n" — just press Enter to confirm
3. **Database password** — pick any password, or press Enter to auto-generate one
4. **LLM API Key** — your LLM provider's API key (DeepSeek, OpenAI, etc.). You can skip this and configure later, but PSOP generation won't work without it

#### Cross-project deployment

Services in separate GCP projects:

```powershell
# Deploy Registry Center to project A
cd PATH_TO_REGISTRY_CENTER
.\deploy-all.ps1

# Deploy Orchestration Center to project B
cd PATH_TO_ORCHESTRATION_CENTER
.\deploy-all.ps1
```

When running the Orchestration Center script:
1. Enter **project B's** Project ID
2. When prompted for Registry Center → enter **project A's** Project ID → script auto-fetches the URL → confirm linkage

> **Cross-project prerequisite**: Registry Center must have `--allow-unauthenticated` enabled (the deploy script enables this by default).

The script then handles everything automatically:
- ✓ Creates database (Cloud SQL PostgreSQL)
- ✓ Builds Docker image
- ✓ Deploys to Cloud Run
- ✓ Configures Registry Center linkage

**About 10-15 minutes total**. You'll see `DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!` when done.

---

## Verify deployment

The script outputs a `https://xxxxx.run.app` URL at the end — that's your service URL.

Test with PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://YOUR_SERVICE_URL/rest/v1/orchestrate/agent-cards"
```

| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Agent list JSON | Working, Registry Center linked |
| `404 "No available agents found"` | Working, but no Agents registered yet |
| `503 "Agent registry unavailable"` | Registry Center linkage needs configuration |

> **404 ≠ failure** — it just means no Agents are registered yet. To verify the Registry Center itself:
> `Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://REGISTRY_URL/agent-cards"`

---

## Post-deployment configuration

If you skipped some configuration during deployment, you can add it later.

### Configure Registry Center linkage

```powershell
# Get Registry Center URL
gcloud run services describe registry-center --region=asia-east1 --format="value(status.url)"

# Configure Orchestration Center (replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID and the URL)
gcloud run services update orchestration-center --region=asia-east1 --project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" --update-env-vars="AGENT_REGISTRY_URL=https://REGISTRY_CENTER_URL"
```

Or just re-run `.\deploy-all.ps1` — existing resources are skipped automatically.

### Configure LLM

PSOP generation and intent orchestration require an LLM — won't work without it:

```powershell
gcloud run services update orchestration-center --region=asia-east1 --project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID" --update-env-vars="LLM_CHAT_PROVIDER=openai,LLM_CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o,LLM_CHAT_API_KEY=sk-xxxxx,LLM_CHAT_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
```

Replace `sk-xxxxx` with your actual API key.

No `A2AT_LLM_*` variables are needed: the service derives the a2a-t-sdk's own configuration
(`etc/conf/a2at.env`) from these at startup, so the negotiation path follows automatically.

### LLM configuration examples

Any OpenAI-compatible provider works. `LLM_CHAT_BASE_URL` is optional — it is derived from
`LLM_CHAT_URL` by stripping `/chat/completions`; set it explicitly only for gateways whose
endpoint path has a different shape.

| Provider | LLM_CHAT_PROVIDER | LLM_CHAT_MODEL | LLM_CHAT_URL |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|
| OpenAI | `openai` | `gpt-4o` | `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek` | `deepseek-chat` | `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions` |
| Qwen / DashScope | `qwen` | `qwen-plus` | `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions` |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: "gcloud not found" error?**

Close PowerShell and reopen. If it still doesn't work, gcloud wasn't installed properly — go back to Step 1.

**Q: "API has not been used" error?**

Wait 1-2 minutes and re-run `.\deploy-all.ps1`. Some APIs take time to activate.

**Q: Deployment failed — how to retry?**

Just re-run `.\deploy-all.ps1`. Already-created resources are skipped automatically.

**Q: 503 "Agent registry unavailable" when verifying?**

Registry Center linkage wasn't configured. See "Configure Registry Center linkage" above.

**Q: Cross-project deployment — Orchestration Center can't reach Registry Center?**

Make sure Registry Center was deployed with `--allow-unauthenticated` (the deploy script does this by default).

**Q: How to update the service?**

After modifying code, just re-run `.\deploy-all.ps1`.

**Q: How to shut down the service?**

```powershell
gcloud run services delete orchestration-center --region=asia-east1 --project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
gcloud sql instances delete orchestration-center-db --project="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```

**Q: Will it conflict with Registry Center in the same project?**

No. Cloud Run service names, Cloud SQL instances, and Service Accounts are all separate. Only the Artifact Registry repo is shared.

**Q: How much does it cost?**

- Cloud Run: free when idle, billed per request
- Cloud SQL (db-f1-micro): ~$0.015/hour per instance
- Two Cloud SQL instances in the same project: ~$0.03/hour total

Delete Cloud SQL instances when not in use to save costs.
